Welcome to Dave's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am currently a student of CodeClan (now facilitated by CodeBase due to liquidation reasons) studying their 16 week Professional Software Development course.

So far on the course I have created projects with technologies such as Python with Flask frameworks, HTML, CSS and databases using MongoDB and PostgreSQL but the highlight has been
working with JavaScript and creating frontends using React, particularly on my group BlackJack project.

Currently I am beginning to learn Java with a focus on SOLID principles and using IntelliJ for the first time.
