Welcome to Dave's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ 
Having previously studied and worked as an Electrical Engineer, this year I made the decision to switch fields into Software and took the leap into CodeClan's 16 week Professional Software Development course.

During the course the highlight for me was working with JavaScript and React but I also created projects using Python and Java with technologies such as Flask, Springs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,  HTML & CSS.

Now I have graduated (congratulations to me) and am focusing on improving the projects I have already begun and creating new ones to further develop my skills.
